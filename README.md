# PlayNote

I created a simple API using ASP.NET Web API and C# for managing game reviews, where people can post reviews for games. Its existence is purely for learning purposes.

This API aims to get familiar with some new technologies and practices in web development. 

I implemented the whole application in an asynchronous way - everything that could be async is async. The application uses MVC using `ControllerBase` and makes calls to the repository layer. The repository layer accesses data `SQLite` via `Entity Framework`. I implemented all the CRUD operations, including full and partial updates using `JSONPatch`. Services for logging and validation were injected using dependency injection. For logging, I used `Serilog` and `FluentValidation` for validation. Routes which return a list of entities are paginated and implement a search feature. The application itself uses a `JWT` token for authentication and authorization. This is implemented just for the sake of understanding rather than the practical use of JWT. Nevertheless, the application uses policy-based authorization and is injected into SwaggerUI. Every piece of code is documented and generates XML and this is also displayed in SwaggerUI.
